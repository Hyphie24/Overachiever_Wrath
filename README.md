**9/9/22 UPDATE**
I will no longer be maintaining/updating Overachiever for Wrath classic or Retail. 
 With wrath classic the addon itself will not load on it's on and without rebuilding a lot of the code (a lot of time I currently do not have) I will have to step away
However,
Krowi, of [Krowi Achievement Filter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/krowi-achievement-filter), has been amazing enough to reach out and help keep and addon working similar to Overachiever (and is still making it better!)

Thank you all! Happy Raiding, leveling, friend making, dungeons & monster slaying fun!

Not Original addon Creator, Just someone who loves the addon who wanted to make it work for Retail & Wrath Classic

Remember to Ignore the original addon on any addon Downloader

Will remove this if addon creator comes back and requests me to remove

I do not own any rights to this, only to help out other Overachievers
