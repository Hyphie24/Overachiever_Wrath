Overachievr for Wrath Classic

**WILL BE UPDATING SEMI REGULARLY THERE IS BUGS TO STILL WORK ON PLEASE BE PATIENT** :D

Not Original addon Creator, Just someone who loves the addon who wanted to make it work for Retail & Wrath Classic

Remember to Ignore the original addon on any addon Downloader

Will remove this if addon creator comes back and requests me to remove

I do not own any rights to this, only to help out other Overachievers

**9/4 UPDATE**
Currently the only way to get the tabs to show up on achievement frame
Tradeskill may be working, do not have a high level crafter toon to see if icons truly work, submit issues if found
if anyone finds the code to get the tabs to show please let me know, any help would do wonders

**STEPS TO LAUNCH TABS**
1. Once in world, open achievement frame
2. Open addon control panel or similar
3. hit load button
